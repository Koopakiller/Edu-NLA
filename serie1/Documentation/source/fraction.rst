Mathematical background
-----------------------

A Fraction objects consists of its instance, a numerator and a denominator.
All calculations obey the rules governing adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing fractions.
If the denominator of a fraction is 0, any calculations involving it will return "NaN".
Subtraction and division default to modified addition and multiplication, and the greatest common divisors are always reduced.
