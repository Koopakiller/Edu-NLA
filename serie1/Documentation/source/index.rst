===================

Welcome to NLA Series 1's documentation!
========================================

This is our implementation for Series 1, Numerical Linear Algebra.
The task was to create a class which can create and execute operations on fractions.
Operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equality and inequality.

The main topic in the problem is object-oriented programming in Python, more specifically working with fractions. 
The following documentation explains how our class Fraction and its associated programs work. 

A number of automated unit tests were carried out to guarantee the correct execution of the Fraction and Prime classes.
The tests were carried out in the implemented main program.

We imported a number of python modules to support our implementation:

Console provided us with functions which make it easier to accept and process user inputs.

Numpy is a package that contains many useful mathematical functions.
