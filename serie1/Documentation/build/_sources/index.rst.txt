Welcome to NLA Series 1's documentation!
========================================

This is our implementation for Series 1, Numerical Linear Algebra. 
The main topic in the problem is object-oriented programming in Python, more specifically working with fractions. 
The following documentation explains how our class Fraction and its associated programs work. 

A number of automated unit tests were carried out to guarantee the correct execution of the Fraction and Prime classes.
The tests were carried out in the implemented main program.
